# ECommerce
This is an e-commerce web application that allows users to browse, search for, and purchase products. Users can create accounts, log in, etc.

# Roles
- Admin - Manages Categories and Products
- User - Browses products and Manages Cart

# Prerequisites
- .Net SDK
- MSSQL

# Challenges
- Most of my challenges came from the initial setup of MSSQL database that needed some restarting and some tweaking on Sql Server Configuration Manager
- Next is setting up the relationships in Entity framework, I encountered some error on Foreign key constraints that just means I used a different colum name from what was expected by the ORM
